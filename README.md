# DSE: Discontinuity Set Extractor
Software for extracting discontinuity sets from 3D point clouds of rock masses.

The Discontinuity Set Extractor (DSE) is a MATLAB-based computer program designed to implement a method for identifying and extracting families of planar discontinuities from 3D point clouds. It is compatible with Windows, MAC, and Linux operating systems.

This method was developed during Adri√°n Riquelme's doctoral thesis at the University of Alicante in 2015. DSE is an open-source program that can be executed on Windows, MAC, and Linux, and it accepts a 3D point cloud as input. Point clouds can be obtained through various means, such as 3D laser scanners (LiDAR or TLS), digital photogrammetry techniques (like SfM), or synthetic data. The program applies a proposed methodology to semi-automatically identify points within an unorganized 3D point cloud that are arranged in 3D space by planes.
