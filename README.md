# DSE: Discontinuity Set Extractor
Software to extract discontinuity sets from rock masses' 3D point clouds

DSE is programmed by Adrián Riquelme for testing part of his PdD studies. Its aim is to extract discontinuity sets from a rock mass. The input data is a 3D point cloud, which can be acquired by means of a 3D laser scanner (LiDAR or TLS), digital photogrammetry techniques (such as SfM) or synthetic data. It applies a proposed methodology to semi-automatically identify points members of an unorganised 3D point cloud that are arranged in 3D space by planes. 

DSE is an open source software programmen in MATLAB. It can currently run on Windows or Linux.
